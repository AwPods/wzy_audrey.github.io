### Hi!
<img src="files/images/cropped bio pic.jpg" alt="my profile photo" style="width:30%;">

I’m Zhiyu (Audrey) Wei, a Master of Public Health candidate at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health, specializing in applied biostatistics. With a background in biochemistry and advanced skills in statistical modeling and geospatial analysis, I focus on leveraging data to address public health challenges. My academic journey also included hands-on wet lab experience, where I developed a strong foundation in experimental research and analytical thinking.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, I discovered my passion for public health advocacy by addressing questions about the virus and vaccines from friends and classmates. My experience as a research assistant in biomedical engineering research on fibromyalgia allowed me to explore the impact of chronic diseases on individuals' lives and sharpen my quantitative skills. These experiences have deepened my commitment to improving public health outcomes through data-driven insights and community-focused solutions.

My research explores topics like food equity, housing disparities, and environmental health, using tools like R, SQL, and QGIS to analyze complex datasets and create actionable insights. I’m passionate about applying data-driven approaches to promote health equity and inform public health policy.
